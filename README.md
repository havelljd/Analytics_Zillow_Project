# Analytics_Zillow_Project
Group project that hooked into an API that scraped Zillow housing data, ran transformations and cleaned the data, and drew analysis from that data. At the time, real estate was booming, so we decided to see what predictions we could make regarding pricing and real-time data if we were to list a house. Our models aimed to take in general housing information and return whether or not the property would be a good buy for the area. 

After some cleaning and EDA, we ran three different models; regression, clustering and classification.
